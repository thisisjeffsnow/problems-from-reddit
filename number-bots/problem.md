## The post was removed, but essentially the question asked:

```

What is the longest true equation that can be formed using every digit from 0 to 9, one plus sign, one minus sign, one multiplication sign, and one division sign? All symbols must be used and none can be used more than once. No parenthesis, exponents or factorials are allowed.

```

## Example solution:

45679â€¢0 + 8/2 -3 = 1
